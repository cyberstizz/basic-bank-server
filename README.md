#      **Basic Bank Server**

## _this is a Django server application created to communicate with a React frontend_

### this project includes
* Python
* Django
* sqlite


### Synopsis
bored I felt it completely appropriate to orchestrate an impulse marriage between our dearly beloved React and Django.


just a simple Django backend with the built in sqlite database to test communications with react. Lets have some fun


### Code Review
this app pretty much comes with the usual setup. urls.py for a list of paths, models.py which holds the orm for the database schema and views.py which describe the actual routes. nothing to crazy here

### final thought
#### this project was designed as a test and a simple project. Some parts of a django server are more convenient than say express, however Django is very opinionated, and does not leave as much room for creativity as I would like. either way its still cool. Thanks for reading and happy coding!!!
